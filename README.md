# LogAI
A simple Ruby script using `ollama-ai` Rubygem.

## Setup
Ensure you have Rubygems Bundler installed.

Run:
Clone repo.
`bundle install` in the directory.
Modify `query_ai.rb` to point to the correct LLM endpoint and log.

## TODO
The following are what I'd like to do next:

- Externalize configuration to yaml file
- Clean up readme
- Add different types of log types
- Integrate with Jenkins?
